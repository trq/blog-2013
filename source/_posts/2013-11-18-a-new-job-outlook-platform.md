I'm on the train on the way to my first day at [Newism][newism]. Butterflies in
my stomach and all I am very excited to be a part of what looks to be an
awesome little company.

I have somewhat outgrown my previous employer. Not that it wasn't still a
challenge, it definitely was. Lot's of legacy code isn't much fun though when
there is so much interesting new stuff happening in the world of PHP. If I
wanted to grow, I needed to be somewhere that would let me.

So, today marks something of a new start.

As well as the normal challengers faced when starting a new role (getting to
know new people, learning new work flows, new code/frameworks), I believe this
role is going to provide me with a mechanism for self improvement on a personal
level. I want to be opinionated. I want to be the guy that others turn to for
advice. I want/need to step up.

You see, this is more senior a role than I am used to. I've learnt a lot over
the years and it really is time for me to start influencing others more.

I'm pretty quiet by nature, so sometimes broadcasting my opinions can be
challenging, but I've come to realise that if I believe in something it pays to
show your passion. Believing in your abilities, your opinions and your beliefs
goes a long way and it is very much something that I want to teach my children.

This new year is going to be awesome. I am determined to make it so.
