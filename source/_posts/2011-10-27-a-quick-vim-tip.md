At work I often have to work on large complex [mysql][mysql] queries, not
wanting to leave [vim][vim] when I don't have to I have this great little
shortcut that allows me to execute queries directly from [vim][vim]. All I need
do is name the file the same as the database I want to execute the query
against, save it (I use the .sql file extension - though it doesn't require
it), then hit <em>leader m</em>. Assuming your setup properly, it will ssh into
my dev-server and execute the query in [mysql][mysql].

Just put this in your ~/.vimrc

    nmap <silent> <Leader>m :!ssh dev-server mysql %:r < %<CR>
