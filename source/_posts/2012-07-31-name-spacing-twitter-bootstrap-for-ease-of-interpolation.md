At work we have a dozen or so apps that share and extend a common CSS base that
we have written and implemented ourselves. Over the last week or so however, I
have been slowly implementing bits and pieces of the awesome [Bootstrap][bs]
framework into one of those apps. In general, it's gone pretty well. I have
taken my time and only pulled in the bits I needed as I needed them. Mostly
just buttons, icons and a few drop down menus.

We have our own version of [bootstrap.less][bsless] which pulls in the
bootstrap code, and also defines any stuff we have overridden. Most of the
@import calls have been commented out, and this is how I had been managing what
was being compiled by [Less][less].

Before I left work this afternoon however, chatting with one of the other devs,
we decided we wanted to start making use of the scaffolding [Bootstrap][bs]
provides. To get this working (and looking good) we would need to pull in
[Bootstrap][bs]'s [scaffolding][bsscaf], [grid][bsgrid], [layouts][bslayouts]
and [reset][reset]. I knew this would break stuff. We needed a solution that
would make this breakage containable.

During development we have [Bootstrap][bs] compiled via [lessphp][leafo] on the
fly. Looking at the [less][less] documentation we found something that looked
promising, [namespaces][less-ns].

Putting [Bootstrap][bs] into it's own namespace would allow us to easily pull
in whatever we need at a document, div or element level. We would also have
complete control of this right where we need it, in our actual templates.

So, how do you namespace [Bootstrap][bs] easily? Simple. Open your
[bootstrap.less][bsless] file and wrap all the @import calls within a
.bootstrap {} block. eg;

    .bootstrap {

    // CSS Reset
    @import "reset.less";

    // Core variables and mixins
    @import "variables.less"; // Modify this for custom colors, font-sizes, etc
    @import "mixins.less";

    // Grid system and page structure
    @import "scaffolding.less";
    @import "grid.less";
    @import "layouts.less";

    // more less ...

    }

That's it. Now, you can use [Bootstrap][bs] by simply applying the _bootstrap_
class to the element surrounding the area you wish to use [Bootstrap][bs].

Now just to covert the rest of the [Bootstrap][bs] JavaScript to not rely on
[jQuery][jquery].
